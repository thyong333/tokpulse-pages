# Privacy Policy for TokPulse

**Effective Date:** September 24, 2025

Thank you for using TokPulse (the "Extension"). This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it.

## 1. Information We Collect

We believe in transparency and collecting only the minimum data necessary to provide and improve our service. We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, or IP address.

The information we collect is categorized as follows:

### a) Anonymous Usage Analytics

To understand how our Extension is used and to improve user experience, we use Google Analytics to collect anonymous, aggregated usage data. This includes:

*   Events such as extension installation (`extension_installed`), popup opens (`popup_opened`), and feature usage (e.g., `filter_used`).
*   An anonymous, randomly generated client ID that cannot be used to personally identify you.

This data helps us understand which features are popular and where we can make improvements. We do not send any personal or sensitive information to Google Analytics. You can learn more about Google's privacy practices in the [Google Analytics Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### b) Extension Configuration Data

To provide a personalized experience, the Extension saves your settings and preferences (such as filter configurations or language choice). This data is stored locally on your computer using the `chrome.storage` API. This data is never transmitted to our servers or any third party. If you are logged into your Google account in Chrome, this data may be automatically synced across your devices, subject to your Chrome sync settings.

### c) Website Content Data

The core functionality of our Extension requires it to read and process content from the websites it operates on (e.g., `tiktok.com`). This includes reading network traffic responses and page content **locally on your device**.

**Crucially, all of this website data is processed only on your computer. It is never sent to, stored on, or logged by our servers or any third-party service.** Its sole purpose is to enable the features of the Extension within your browser.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

*   **To Provide and Maintain the Service:** We use the locally processed website content data and your stored configuration data to deliver the core features of the Extension.
*   **To Improve the Service:** We use the anonymous usage analytics to identify bugs, understand feature popularity, and make informed decisions about future development.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any user information to outside parties. As we do not collect any personally identifiable information, there is nothing for us to share.

## 4. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the information handled by our Extension. All data processing occurs locally on your device, and communication with Google Analytics is done securely via HTTPS.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
